Prompt the user for the first number: Use the input() function to get the user's input and convert it to a number type (e.g., float) for calculation.

Prompt the user for the second number: Similarly, get the second number from the user and convert it to a numeric type.

Ask the user to input the operation: Prompt the user to enter the operation symbol (+, -, *, or /).

Perform the selected operation:

Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to check the operation symbol.

Perform addition if +, subtraction if -, multiplication if *, or division if /.

Handle invalid operations gracefully by informing the user.
